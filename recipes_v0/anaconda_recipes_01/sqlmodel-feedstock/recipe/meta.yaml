    # Unfortunately sqlmodel relies on a custom plugin called "poetry-version-plugin"
    # which relies on the development version of poetry, which is annoying to install
    # on conda-forge. But why install some weird plugin when we can just use a simple
    # Bash hack? ;)

    - grep __version__ sqlmodel/__init__.py | grep {{ version }}

  description: |
    SQLModel is designed to simplify interacting with SQL databases in FastAPI
     applications, it was created by the same author. It combines SQLAlchemy
     and Pydantic and tries to simplify the code you write as much as possible,
     allowing you to reduce the code duplication to a minimum, but while getting
     the best developer experience possible. SQLModel is, in fact, a thin layer
     on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, carefully designed to be compatible with
     both.
